#
# docker-compose.yml
#
# Launch emulators; provide a means to warm them up.
#
# Used by:
#   - manual development ('docker compose up -d' directly or via 'npm run up')
#   - CI
#     - with 'docker-compose.ci.yml' overrides
#
#   Current folder: sample
#
# Environment:
#   - CI_BUILDER_IMAGE (optional); name of the builder image.
#
# Intentions:
#   Within a Docker universe,
#     - launch Firebase Emulators using 'firebase.json'
#       - exposing ports for Firestore and Cloud Functions (Firebase Auth port not needed)
#
# Docker Compose (v3) note:
#   BE CAREFUL with use of pipe ('|') or '&&' in the commands! See -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68590318/14455
#
# NOTE!!! 🎉🎉🎉
#   From 'docker-compose' 1.27 onwards:
#     - 'version' field is optional (don't use it; see below!!)
#     - 'depends_on' long syntax [1] IS BACK (which is ultra handy!!!)
#
#   This was VERY CONFUSING because for a while, because there was deviation between the versions and the Internet
#   saying 'depends_on: xxx: condition' is going away. It isn't. Even the Webstorm IDE syntax highlighting is FINE
#   with it as long as you don't have a 'version: 3.0' entry.

  # WARM UP the engines
  #
  # Firebase Emulators are SLOW to wake. This part runs a minimal set of tests (the results of which are not used),
  # to wake up the necessary subsystems server-side. This results in more dependable test times in the actual tests.
  #
  # Note: Instead of returning, the service is kept running. This guarantees that the warm-up is only ever run once,
  #     per 'emul' instance.
