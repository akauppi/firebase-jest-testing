#
# .gcloudignore
#
# Defines the files *not* sent to Cloud Build.
#
# Note:
#   We could go with the default (that is built by '.gitignore' files), but there are some other, unnecessary paths that
#   don't need to be in the build.
#
# List files that would be sent:
#   <<
#     # in project root
#     $ gcloud meta list-files-for-upload
#   <<
#

# Default (follow the '.gitignore's):
#
.gcloudignore
.git
.gitignore
.npmignore
#!include:.gitignore

# ^-- Note: '#!include' is a command; not a comment!

# No need for submodules
/**/.gitmodules

# Global '.gitignore' (of the author); not observed by Cloud Build defaults
#
