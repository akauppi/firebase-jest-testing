Tools for testing Firebase backend features, using Jest.

<!--
Can designed in Fusion 360, by A.Kauppi - https://a360.co/3fHTV9y
-->

Offers:

- ü•´ Emulator detection. The library *automatically picks up the configuration* when running the tests. Less boilerplate!

- ü™∂ Light. Uses Firestore *REST API* so *no Firebase client JS SDK* is required.

   This is an implementation detail. In practise, it means less npm dependencies. 

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast. Optimized for multithreading and Node.js. You'll likely max out your cores.

   This may be overpromising. The Firebase Emulators themselves are the bottleneck, and there's an issue for handling this. Anyways, we are pushing for speedy testability of Firebase backend.

- ‚Äñ‚Äñ‚Äñ Security Rules are tested **immutably** - a passing write or delete operation does not change the data, and cannot disturb other tests. This is why we can parallelize the tests so much. No flaky tests.

- üë®‚Äçü¶Ø Help functions for priming of Firestore with *JSON data*.

   Firebase emulators provide binary import/export which is not very useful for small, hand-crafted datasets. JSON is more human friendly.
   
- `+` Means for testing callables <sub>(without a client SDK)</sub>.


Only to be used with Jest 28 and above.

   The aim for this repo is on ESM projects and Jest 28 brings this support. Thus the lack of interest for supporting even Jest 27 (it is possible, using some hacks - see release `0.0.4-alpha.5`).

## Requires

- Node 18

   <small>..because it has built-in `fetch`. If you really need Node 16 compatibility ([undici](https://www.npmjs.com/package/undici?activeTab=readme) needs Node >= 16.5), add `import { fetch } from 'undici'` to the sources. It will work. The author just didn't need Node 16 compatibility.</small>
   
- Jest 28 as a peer dependency


## Using in your project

In your application project:

```
$ npm install --save-dev firebase-jest-testing@beta
```

<!-- no longer needed (Jest 28)
Add this to the `jest.config.js`:

```
// Needed until Jest supports ESM's with multiple entry points (Jest 28?).
//
resolver: "hack-jest/jestResolver.cjs"
```

Create the custom Jest resolver. 

<details><summary>Sample `jestResolver.cjs`</summary>
<pre>
/*
* hack-jest/jestResolver.cjs
*
* Note: It's really CHEAP that we don't use the 'exports' in the package itself, but this works, and eventually
*    Jest will support 'exports' for real. Also, we've narrowed down to only those entries that we need.
*
* References:
*   - Configuring Jest > resolver (Jest docs)
*     -> https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#resolver-string [1]
*/

// Add mappings to any libraries you use which 'export' more than the default ('.') entry point (Jest 27 takes care of that).
//
const entries = Object.entries({
  // firebase-jest-testing
  "firebase-jest-testing/firestoreAdmin": "./src/firestoreAdmin/index.js",
  "firebase-jest-testing/firestoreAdmin/setup": "./src/firestoreAdmin/setup/index.js",
  "firebase-jest-testing/firestoreRules": "./src/firestoreRules/index.js",
  "firebase-jest-testing/firebaseClientLike": "./src/firebaseClientLike/index.js",

  // firebase-admin
  "firebase-admin/app": "./lib/esm/app/index.js",
  "firebase-admin/firestore": "./lib/esm/firestore/index.js"

}).map( ([k,v]) => {
  const arr = k.match(/(.+?)\//);   // pick the node_modules name
  const name = arr[1] || fail("No '/' in key");
  return [
    k,
    v.replace(/^\.\//, `${name}/`)
  ]
});

const lookup = new Map(entries);

const res = ( request, options ) => {   // (string, { ..see above.. }) => ...

  const hit = lookup.get(request);
  if (hit) {
    return options.defaultResolver( hit, options );
  } else {
    return options.defaultResolver( request, options );
  }
};

module.exports = res;
</pre>
</details>

### Using with Docker Compose

With Docker Compose, your emulators are likely running under another host than the one running the Jest tests.

Set the `EMUL_HOST` env.var. to indicate the host name.

```
services:
  emul:
    ...
  sample:
    ...
    environment: ['EMUL_HOST=emul']
```

<!-- Editor's note:
Did not find a way to link from 'npmjs.org' `README` to the `Writing tests.md` within the same published package.

The only solutions are:
- linking to another page (maybe keep by versions)
- bring all that text here? (..which may be good? :) - then rename this "Writing tests" )
