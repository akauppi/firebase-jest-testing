# docker-compose.yml
#
# FOR CI ONLY.
#
#   Using Docker Compose helps us test the library on both Node 14 and Node 16. The purpose is _not_ to burden the
#   developer experience (and documentation) with Docker. This file is only used for CI.
#
# Context:
#   - Cloud Build, with 'firebase-ci-builder' image in the Container Registry
#
# Environment values (Cloud Build):
#   - 'CI_BUILDER_IMAGE'
#   - 'NODE': "14"
#
#   - pwd: /workspace
#
# Intentions:
#   - Test with Node 14
#   - Test with Node 16
#
# Docker Compose (v3) note:
#   BE CAREFUL with use of pipe ('|') or '&&' in the commands! See -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68590318/14455
