#
# Intention:
#   Check that the project installs and runs the tests, using
#     - Node 14; npm 6
#     - Node 16; npm 7 (not currently enabled)
#
# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace'
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home
#
# Triggers:
#   - functional changes to 'master' branch
#     - changes only affecting '.md' files are excluded
#
# BIG NOTE!!!
#   ONLY use the 'docker-compose' (custom) image using its default entrypoint. It NOT ONLY starts 'docker compose'
#   but ALSO moves the plugin under '/builder/home', suitable for CI.

#--- Node 14 ---
#
# As of Aug-21:
#   - node 14.17.5
#   - npm 6.14.14
#
# Note:
#   Warnings on 'fsevents' (optional dependency; not needed in Linux) *only* happen with npm 6. 'npm install -f'
#   removes them, but adds its own. REMOVE THESE NOTES once not supporting ´npm@6', any more.
#
#   See:
#     "How to solve npm install throwing fsevents warning on non-MAC OS?" (SO)
#       -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46929196/how-to-solve-npm-install-throwing-fsevents-warning-on-non-mac-os

- name: node:14-alpine
  entrypoint: npm
  args: ['install']
    #
    # CI gives these warnings:
    #   <<
    #     Step #0: npm WARN lifecycle @local/root@~postinstall: cannot run in wd @local/root@ npm --prefix sample/functions install (wd=/workspace/node_modules/@local/self)
    #     Step #0: npm WARN lifecycle @local/root@~postinstall: cannot run in wd @local/root@ npm --prefix sample/functions install (wd=/workspace)
    #     Step #0: npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
    #   <<
    #
    # This DOES NOT happen with same npm version, locally (at least, not on that version on macOS).
    #
    # The outcome is that 'sample/functions' doesn't get installed. We remedy that with the extra step below.
    #

  entrypoint: npm

#--- Node 16 ---
# ...
# Have problems running with Node 16, under Docker Compose, so left for #later.
#
# Ideally, it would be nice to run CI jobs on both versions. `#contribute`?

# --- Timeout
#
# Takes:
#   CI: 1m48s, 1m53s (Node 14 only)
#
timeout: 240s
