# Changelog

## 3-Oct-21

- CI changes:
  - running tests with Docker, but not Docker Compose
  - warm-up remains for CI: sometimes needed (see `APPROACH.md`)

## 2-Sep-21

- Updating dependency: `node-fetch@3.0.0`

## 29-Aug-21

- Proper warming up of Cloud Functions **finally** implemented. With DC.
- CI test time of the first Rules test reduced, by running it first in `beforeAll`.

This means we can now comfortably use a 2000 ms timeout for all tests, in the CI, and they will pass.

## 22-Aug-21 (0.0.4-alpha.4)

- Brought back support for `npm` 6.
- CI scripts with help of Docker Compose (`docker/compose` image 1.29.2).
- moved temporary files to use `/tmp`

## 18-Aug-21 (0.0.4-alpha.3)

- **ADD**: Ability to set emulator host via `EMUL_HOST` env.var. Needed for use under Docker Compose.

## 17-Jul-21 (0.0.4-alpha.2)

- **FIX**: Clean up remaining `doc` listeners, allowing Jest to return to OS prompt. Counteracts [Jest #11464](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/11464) Unfortunately no Firebase Admin SDK issue, though the root cause is likely there.
- **CHANGE**: No more leaking through Firebase Admin SDK APIs, but exposing only selected methods, deemed useful for testing.
- **CLEANUP**: Removed old (commented out) `eventually` code
- **OPTIMIZATION**: 10..20% speed improvement on rules tests, due to transferring primed data via "intercom" temporary files.

## 30-Jun-21 (0.0.3-beta.4b)

- **BUG FIX**: Resolver fixed so `firestoreAdmin` works, from customer project.

## 29-Jun-21 (0.0.3-beta.4)

- **REWORK:** `preheat_EXP` replaces `listener_EXP` (same thing, more focused role, reduced implementation)
- **BIG CHANGE:** using the "modular API" Admin SDK (still in alpha)
- Docs revised (root and `ci`).
- **CHANGE (API):** Removed `eventually` - was too specific and can be done in tests.
- **CHANGE (SAMPLE):** No launch of emulators if there is an active Firebase project.
- **FIX (SAMPLE)**: Using `demo-1` as the project ID (makes Firebase Emulators play local)

## 13-Jun-21 (0.0.3-beta.3)

- **[REWORK]** Global lock waiting no longer polls, but listens to the document changes.
- **[API CHANGE]** `eventually` returns a Promise; no longer a polling Jest extension.

## 27-May-21 (0.0.3-beta.2)

- Updated to Jest 27.0.1
- **CHANGE:** Moved `firebase-admin` to be an implementation detail (dependency instead of peer dependency)
- Updated to `firebase-admin` 9.9.0, `firebase-tools` 9.12.0
- **FIX:** Added `setRegion` for `firebaseClientLike` (callables testing), due to Cloud Functions Emulators in 9.12.0 being aware of regions.

## 19-May-21 (0.0.3-alpha.3)

- Documentation revise

## 16-May-21 (0.0.3-alpha.2)

- Re-implemented efficient locking.
- Implemented also `arrayRemove` and `arrayUnion` sentinels/transforms, using `Symbol`.
- Implemented `firebaseClientLike` for `httpsCallables` testing.

## 11-May-21 (0.0.3-alpha.0)

- Replaced `@firebase/rules-unit-test` with REST API calls.

## 6-May-21 (0.0.3-alpha.0)

## 5-Apr-21 (0.0.2-beta.5)

- Changed Jest configuration files to use `export`.

## 3-Apr-21 (0.0.2-beta.4)

- **CHANGE**: Removed `cloudFunctions` from the exported features; keeping this server-side only. Sample code is provided in the `README` in case the downstream wants to test callables (only case where one needs a client side library in addition to `firebase-admin`).
- Updated dependencies

## 25-Mar-21 (0.0.2-beta.3)

- Needing `npm` >= 7.7.0 (or likely works with `npm` 6)

## 21-Feb-21 (0.0.2-beta.1)

## 26-Sep-20 (0.0.1-beta.3)

## 23-Aug-20 (0.0.1-alpha.7)

- `node-fetch` added
- `proper-lockfile` added (omitted by mistake)

## 21-Aug-20

- removed the use of `firebase use`. Replaced with `--project=bunny`, see [#1](https://github.com/akauppi/firebase-jest-testing/issues/1)

## 20-Aug-20

- using Jest custom resolver to be able to use package `exports`
- picking active project only from `GCLOUD_PROJECT` (well, fallback to run `firebase use`)

## 19-Aug-20 (0.0.1-alpha.3)
